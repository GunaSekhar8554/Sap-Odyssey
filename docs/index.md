# Welcome to SAP Odyssey 🚀

Welcome everyone who is joining me on my journey through SAP! I am an SAP BTP consultant, currently working on PI/PO to Integration Suite migration.

But my curiosity doesn't stop there—I am always interested in learning different technologies.

This site is where I share the knowledge I’ve gained in the past and post new things I explore, both here and on community blogs.

**My philosophy:** Every complex topic can be learned and understood if broken down into more granular parts. There’s no shortcut—just a thousand micro-decisions no one claps for.
